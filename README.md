# Agricultural Robotics Lab
Welcome to the Ag Robotics Lab of the Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering (BBE) of University of Minnesota Twin Cities

Our mission is to apply advanced ideas of robotics, remote sensing, data mining and information technology into precision agriculture. The core techniques we use include multispectral/hyperspectral imaging, spectroscopy, machine learning, geographic information system (GIS), digital mapping, biochemical sensing, etc. The tools available for carrying out our researches are unmanned aerial vehicle, unmanned ground vehicle, video camera, multispectral camera, hyperspectral camera, DGPS, and various electrical, optical and chemical sensors.
